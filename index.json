I am a member of the software team in the RoboCup@Home subteam.\nThe objective of RoboCup@Home is to build a household assistant robot that can perform a variety of tasks, including carrying bags, introducing and seating guests at a party, answering a variety of trivia questions and more. Open Robotics is developing a robot to compete in the 2021 RoboCup@Home Education Challenge while in the meantime, our subteam will compete in the 2020 Competition using the Turtlebot 2 as our hardware platform.\nThe Challenge The rules for the 2020 Challenge can be found here, but they boil down to three specific tasks:\n Carry My Luggage - Navigation task Find My Mates - Vision task Receptionist - Speech task  Carry My Luggage Goal: The robot helps the operator to carry a bag to the car parked outside\nStarting at a predifined location, the robot has to find the operator and pick up the bag the operator is pointing to. After picking up the bag, the robot needs to indicate that it is ready to follow and then it must follow the operator while facing 4 obstacles along the way (crowd, small object, difficult to see 3D object, small blocked area).\nFind My Mates Goal: The robot fetches the information of the party guests for the operator who knows only the names of the guests.\nKnowing only the operator, the robot must identify unknown people and meet those that are waving. Afterwards, it must remember the person and provide a unique description of that person, as well as that person\u0026rsquo;s location, to the operator.\nReceptionist Goal: The robot has to take two arriving guests to the living room, introducing them to each other, and offering the just-arrived guest an unoccupied place to sit.\nKnowing the host of the party, John, the robot must identify unknown guests, request their names and favourite drinks and then point to an empty seat where the guest can sit.\n My Contributions My main contributions have been in speech recognition and in handle segmentation, targeting tasks 3 and 1 respectively, however I also worked on facial recognition earlier in the project.\nSpeech Recognition You can find this repository here\nHandle Segmentation You can find this repository here\n ","date":1591395502,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591395502,"objectID":"ff62214a94179c9a208c44ab9465861e","permalink":"https://Fquico1999.github.io/project/openrobotics/","publishdate":"2020-06-05T15:18:22-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/openrobotics/","section":"project","summary":"Developing Software to compete in the RoboCup@Home competition.","tags":["Deep Learning","Computer Vision"],"title":"UBC Open Robotics","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1591395484,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591395484,"objectID":"c5502dda16902d094db7bd7a7a1a664d","permalink":"https://Fquico1999.github.io/project/enph353/","publishdate":"2020-06-05T15:18:04-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/enph353/","section":"project","summary":"Implemeted YOLO to navigate a simulated course.","tags":["Deep Learning","Computer Vision"],"title":"ENPH 353: Machine Learning Competition","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"See the paper here\n","date":1591395470,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591395470,"objectID":"76a23cb2e44a62212c48b3b816da0d43","permalink":"https://Fquico1999.github.io/project/eece571t/","publishdate":"2020-06-05T15:17:50-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/eece571t/","section":"project","summary":"A Project for EECE 571T - Advanced Machine Learning Tools - Where I created a pipeline to detect FOXP3+ biomarkers in follicular lymphoma TMA cores.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"EECE 571T: Artifact Removal \u0026 Biomarker Segmentation","type":"project"}]
